Time value of money 

simple interest  = 10% 

t | amount  | interest 
---------|----------|---------
 0 | 100 | 10
 1 | 110 | 10
 2 | 120 | 


compound interest: 

got interest of interest 

still 10 percent 

t | amount  | interest 
---------|----------|---------
 0 | 100 | 10
 1 | 110 | 11
 2 | 110(1+r) = 121 |  10
 3 | 100(1+r)^3

 Excel functions 

 FV future value 

 PV present value 

 NPV Net Present Value : the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time.
 
 PMT : Excel PMT function payment function calculate repayment amount on a loan 
 
 NPER : Returns the number of periods for an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.
 
 RATE 

 100/(1+i)^N = PV of 100 in the future 

 net present value 


## Lecture 3 

future value and present value 

sum together each year's PV becomes the whole pv of the future value
