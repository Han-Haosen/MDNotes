The Big Picture 

start -- large glowing ball of gas that generates heat and light through nuclear fusion -- plasma, nucleon is seperated from electron 


planets, shines by reflected light, planets may be rocky, icy or gaseous in composition 

great island of stars in space, all held together by gravity and orbiting a common center

observable universe is different from actual universe 

light travels at the same, finite speed 

destination 8 minutes from sun, Sirius 8 years 

redshift is a measure of speed 

Lesson 2 

Understanding the sky 

using angles to observe the sky 

full circle 360 2 pie radians 

arcminutes 

artseconds 

angular size = physical size * 360 degrees / 2pie * distance 

formula works if angle is small 

small angles a = s 

i.e the part of the circle vs linear size
