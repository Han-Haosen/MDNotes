The Big Picture 

start -- large glowing ball of gas that generates heat and light through nuclear fusion -- plasma, nucleon is seperated from electron 


planets, shines by reflected light, planets may be rocky, icy or gaseous in composition 

great island of stars in space, all held together by gravity and orbiting a common center

observable universe is different from actual universe 

light travels at the same, finite speed 

destination 8 minutes from sun, Sirius 8 years 

redshift is a measure of speed 

Lesson 2 

Understanding the sky 

using angles to observe the sky 

full circle 360 2 pie radians 

arcminutes 

artseconds 

angular size = physical size * 360 degrees / 2pie * distance 

formula works if angle is small 

small angles a = s 

i.e the part of the circle vs linear size 

## Lecture 3 

Angular size  etc

angular size = physical size * 360 degrees / (2 pi * distance)


angular diameter of the Sun 

diameter = 1.392*10^9 m 

distance = 1.496*10^11 m 

angular size = physical size/distance convert to degrees from radians

small angle approximation

size of sun angular =0.0093 * 360 / 2pi = 0.533 

angular distance, angle between two points on the sky 

angular size of sun around 1/2 degrees 

proper motion is how much an object moves per unit time in angles, i.e angular speed 

angular resolution 

diffraction limit 

$$ \lambda / D $$

0.1 arcseconds for Hubble Space telescope 

Classical Astronomy 

where things are in the sky and how they move

the milky way 

band of light making a circle 

constellations

star pattern 

celestial sphere 

celestial equator 

north celestial pole 

ecliptic is the sun's apparent path through the celestial sphere 

23.5 degrees tilted line, 

meridian 

zenith : altitude 90% 

horizon altitude = 0% 

line passing thorugh zenith and connecting N and S points on horizon

latitude 

longitude 

zodiac point of view 

sky varies as Earth orbits the sun 

move eastward along the ecliptic 

Earth's orbit changes the apparent location of the Sun among the stars

axis tilt changes direction of sunlight during the year 

Axis is always pointed in the same direction in space but Earth moves around the Sun 

Sun's altitude changes with seasons 

direct sunlight 

Analemma snapshot at noon

orbit is not a perfect circle


## Lecture 4 

Sun does not set in the polar area 

why doesn't distance from sun matter 

Orbit is an ellipse 

variation of Earth Sun distance about 3 %, small variation is overwhelmed by effects of axis tilt 

summer solstice 
winter solstice 

equinox 

Precession 

Earth's axis almost point the same way 

but 26000 years, spin actually changes 

The polaris would point to different constalations 

23.5 degree tilt 

length of the day 

Solar day: longer than a sideral day by about 1/360 because Earth moves about 1 degree in orbit per day around the sun 

The moon, eclipses, phases of the moon 

Ashen moon : Earth Shine 


27.3 day orbit around earth

waxing waning 

Lunar Eclipses and Solar eclipses

penumbral

partial 

total 

annual solar eclipse 

Lunar eclipse only happens at full moon

Solar Eclipses only happen at new moon


## lecture 5 

Orbits and Gravity 

copernican revolution 

challenge the earth-centered model 

3 laws of planetary motion 

Galileo solidifies it 

Earth-centered Universe 

Retrograde motion 

planets should be moving east wards

but sometimes go westward relative to the stars for a few weeks 

Pre-Copernican Astronomy 

it will rotate in a little circle for a while when retrograde motion happens 

consider relative speed 

see apparent retrograde motion when we pass by a planet in its orbit 

Copernicus -- not as accurate as you think it is 

Sun centric, perfect circles -- should be ellipses 

Tycho Brahe 

most accurate naked eye measurements of planetary positions 

Still could not detect stellar parallax. Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, 

thought Earth is still center but realized other planets go around Sun

Kepler used Tycho's observations to discover the truth 


8 arc minutes discrepency lead to discovering a not so circle orbit 

calculating ellipse 

with two focuses and major axis, minor axis 

eccentric ellipse 


focus deviate from center 


orbit of each planet around the sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus 

Perihelion and aphelion, near and far 

2nd law : equal time the planet sweep throught equal areas for the line connecting sun and planet 

travels faster when closer to sun 

conversation of angular momentum: 

mass * velocity * distance 

p^2 = a^3 

p = orbital period in years 

a = semi-major axis of orbit in AU astronomical unit 

//does not work with anything beyond sun and planets
