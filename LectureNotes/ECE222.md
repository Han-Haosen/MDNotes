## Review of Number Systems

binary representation

voltage/current/switch/capacitator to represent 0/1

V(b) = Bn-1*2^n-1+... b0*20

36 = ?

36/2 0
18/2 0
9/2 1
4/2 0
2/2 0
1/2 1

100100

for that much digits largest num = 2^n-1

8 bit -- 2^8 -1

generally you need log2(k) bits when you sum

4 nubers, 2 extra bits
8 numbers, 3 extra bits

multiply, extra bits?

2n bits

positive numbers are the same

negative numbers complements

signed presentation is irrelevant -- if 0, positive, 1 negative

width need to be large enough to avoid overflow

if possesses same sign, result is different sign

making result 1 bit larger

Introduction to Lab 1

Flashing LED

IO port addressing and ocnfig

flashing LED flowhart

THUMB assembly language instructions

different memory addressing mode

test/debug on Keil

on-board RAM

Status bits and conditional branching

ALU -- Arithmatic and Logic Units

status bits are output after every computation

ZNCV Zero Negative Carry Overflow// flags

SUBS -- output flags

I/O ports and peripherals have assigned unique addresses from memory address space

address need to be used to communicate

config of I/O port must be done first


I/O is like memory except not actually doing that

1HZ

on for 0.5 and off for 0.5

check value if 0 make it 1 and vice versa

XOR function  when you do it to 1 it always invert the value

when want to toggle

place 1 at the position where you want to toggle

masking value

used in bit operations

Range for 2's complement 2^n-1 - 1 to -2^n-1

U(A bar) = 2^n - u(a)

+2 0010

-2 1110

6+-6 0110+1010 = 10000 = 0

carry because 2's complement

-2+-6

= -8

obtain a carry

1000

2^n - u(2) + 2^n -u(6)

4 bit and 8 bit representation

-4 = 11111100


## Computer Organization

The range of addresses is known as the address space

Control Unit performs two functions: 1.Fetches instructions from memory

2.Orchestrates instruction execution

Bus is a set of signal wires whose use may be shared by multiple functional units over time

implemented using tri-state drivers

one functional may write a signal to a bus at one time

Writing a signal to a bus is referred to as bus driving

A bus conflict occurs if two functional units drive the bus at the same time

One functional unit drives a bus, the other functional units must
enter a high impedance state to avoid a bus conflict

control unit ensures that only one functional unit drives the bus at
one time


memory data register (MDR) is implemented within a
CPU to temporarily store the data

memory address register (MAR) is implemented within a
CPU to temporarily store the address

CPU’s typically treat input / output units as memory devices

– This technique is known as memory-mapped I/O

– I/O devices monitor control signals and address signals to determine
when to transfer data

Load - Read a data operand from memory or an input device
into the processor register

– Load R2, LOC
• Read the memory contents from address LOC and load them into processor
register R2

Store - Write a data operand from a processor register to
memory or an output device
– Store R4, LOC
• Copy contents of R4 to memory location LOC

ARM has R0-R15

One of the address registers is often used as a hardware stack pointer for
the call stack in memory (R13 in ARM, A7 in ColdFire)

– Reduced Instruction Set Computers  
– Each instruction implements a simple function  
• E.g. add, sub, not  
– Multiple simple instructions are combined to form complex functionality  
– Much simpler for compilers to generate code for RISC machines  
– ARM uses a RISC ISA  


## ECE 222 Tutorial Sep 17

ADD R4,R2,R3
Step 1 Program counter
step 3 send the instructions decode tell Registers which one to output
Step 2 retrieve from RAM
Step 4 put it in ALU
Step 5 write back to R4 and PC increment

Store R4,LOC

Mid term question

Q1 2017

-11 1 01011
-16 1 10000

5 bit 1's complement
10100
can't represent -16

5-bit 2's complements

RISC vs CISC

RISC must load to registers before operate

ARM uses RISC

CISC -- don't know the size of operations

IA32(x86) vary from 1 byte to 15 bytes

RISC is fixed(one word )

2 Address instruction
ADD A,B
1.5 Address instructions
ADD A,D0
1 Address
ADD A
0 Address Instruction RTS

Components/Instructions/Registers

Instruction Sets and Addressing Modes

conditional code // flags

Memory Addressing

do not allow instructions to directly address a single bit

range is known as address space

2^32 addressable locations

byte addressable

may refer to a particular byte or a particular word

adjacent words are differ by the number of bytesi n a word

given 24 bit, a byte addressable system supports 16 mib memory

exactly 1024 Bytes

in a word addressable memory system, instructions refer to a particular words

adjacent words are located in addresses only differ by 1

0x0000 0x0001 for words

24 bit addresss, word addressable memory system supports 64MiB of memory

rarely used

Big-Endian or Little Endian

low addresses to left most bytes for Bit and vice versa

word alignment

word 0 0x0000
word 1 0x0004
