Prof Robert Hackman

SE is to improve quality, productivity, larger systems, evolvability

More real world focus 

ADT Design, -- productivity 

Modules and Interfaces

Exceptions

Interface Specifications

OO design Principles 

Design Patterns 

UML modelling -- productivity 

Generic Programming (Templates, STL)

Testing/Debugging 

Monday 3:30 - 5 

12 Hours of Module Design

12 OO

Thinking in C++ need to read those 

15% Assignments 

A1 May 24

A2 June 14 

A3 July 30 

5% each 

Between A2 and A3 are projects 

Project 2 or 3 people 

Group of 3 best 

July 19-21 do the demo 

must be able to run and compile linux.students.cs.uwaterloo.ca

June 28/July 16 demo projects

Midterm 20% Final 50%

Tutorials, introduce tools and more examples, discussing assignment
 
C++ has inheritance 

Private and Public 

MyClass C in C++: 

Default Constructor

Riase level of abstraction, interfaces 

Reuse 

Modularity 

Information Hiding

Polymorphism 

## ADT Design 

Abstract Data type, user defined, implementation might vary but same methods 

Bundles together 

1. Range of Valid Values/Data
2. Functions over those values 

Ideally use help of compiler to enforce users to use it properly 

* ADT allow us to employ outside in design 

Basically encapsulating a convoluted data and make it clearer for the client to use it, just knowing the interface, not how it's done 

Client - Interface - Implementation Details 

```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std

int main() {
    cout << "Enter a rational(a/b): ";
    Rational r, p, q;
    cin >> r, 
    cout << "Enter a ratioanl(a/b):";
    cin >> q;
    cout << r;
    p = q + r;
    cout << p;
    cout << q / p;
}
```

default constructor? No params 

overload input operator with istream& and a rational&, mutate that object

overload output operator with ostream& and a rational& or not (should const) faster, no copy 

can't copy the streams 

overload additional operators with rationals 

pass rationals const reference 

return by value for rational -- created a new value 

assignment operator -- copy & move 

division opereator 

copy constructor Rational z(q) 

big 3:

destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator -- exception free 


## May 6th After Lecture

### UML Diagrams

diamond is association, 

inheritance, arrow points from derived class to base class 

is a vs is like a 

interchangeable objects with polymorphism 

late binding vs early binding OOP uses late binding 

virtual functions

```
void doStuff(Shape& s){
    s.erate();
    s.draw();
}

Circle C;
Triangle t;
doStuff(c);

This does the right thing 

```

treat a derived type as if it is a base type upcasting 

new and delete 

garbage collector for C++ is handled by programmers 


Exception handling 

Exception is an object thrown from site of error and can be caught by exception handlers 

declaration vs definition 

extern key word: definition is external to the file, or occurs later

headers 

linking 

linker collects object modules like .o or .obj generated by compiler 

Link the library into the executable program. 

class member function abc::aaa();


short int, int, long int

float, double, long double

singed, unsigned 

declare it using ::, use using dot
