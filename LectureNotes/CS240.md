Problem, count positive integers in an array

An instance : [1,2,3,4,5]

solution: 15

size of an instance(length of the array)

Initialize a counter to zero, one pass over array, for any entry A[i] if A[i] > 0, increment counter 


or 
```

count(a)

res = 0 
for i = 0... n-1,
if A[i] > 0
    res ++
return res

```

running time and auxiliary space 

amount of time/memory are dependent on Size(I)

Running Time Analysis:

No implementing

Independent of Environment

All input instances 

Random Access Machine MOdel

idealied model 

order notation 

ignore constants and lower order terms 

Order Notation 

F(n) = 75n + 500 
g(n) = 5n2

1. for n >= 20 25*20 <= 25n
2. for n >= 20 20n < n2 -> 100n <= 5n2

first principle proof

2n2 + 3n + 11 <= cn2 for all n >= n0

for n>=1 2n^2 < 2n^2 

3n <= 3n^2

11 <= 11n^2

f(n) <= 16n^2 = 16g(n)

so, taking n0 = 1 c = 16, this proves f(n) belongs O(g(n))
