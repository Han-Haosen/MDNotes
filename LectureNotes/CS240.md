Problem, count positive integers in an array

An instance : [1,2,3,4,5]

solution: 15

size of an instance(length of the array)

Initialize a counter to zero, one pass over array, for any entry A[i] if A[i] > 0, increment counter 


or 
```

count(a)

res = 0 
for i = 0... n-1,
if A[i] > 0
    res ++
return res

```

order notation

Order Notation 

F(n) = 75n + 500 
g(n) = 5n2

1. for n >= 20 25*20 <= 25n
2. for n >= 20 20n < n2 -> 100n <= 5n2

first principle proof

2n2 + 3n + 11 <= cn2 for all n >= n0

for n>=1 2n^2 < 2n^2 

3n <= 3n^2

11 <= 11n^2

f(n) <= 16n^2 = 16g(n)

so, taking n0 = 1 c = 16, this proves f(n) belongs O(g(n))

## Lecture 2 5/9

find C and n0 such that it is satisfied 

omega notation exists c > 0 n0 > 0 such that c|g(n)| <= \f(n)\

theta notation 

theta means f(n) is both O(gn) and Omega(gn)

tight bound 

omega is lower bound 

f(n) belongs to Omega(g(n))

there exists C and n0 such that both > 0 

for n >= n0 f(n) >= c g(n) lower bound on run time 

theta means both omega and Big O 

prove f(n) 2n2 + 3n + 11 belongs to Omega(n2)

for all n >= 1 2n^2 >= 2n^2
3n >= 0
11 >= 0

f(n) >= 2n2 = 2g(n)
taking c = 2 and n0 = 1,that proves f(n) belongs Omega(n)

1/2 n^2 - 5n belongs omega(n^2)

f(n) = 1/2 n^2 -5n
g(n) = n^2 

let n >= 20 n^2 >= 20n 
1/4 n^2 >= 5n 
```
-5n >=  -1/4 n^2
1/2n^2 - 5n >= -1/4 n^2 + 1/2n^2 i.e 1/4 n^2 

```
f(n) >= 1/4 g(n) absolute values 

therefore by FP, Omega true 

Taking n0 = 20 and c = 1/4 thus proves Omega 

prove logb(n) belongs to theta(log n) for all b > 1 from first principles 

f(n) = logb(n) log(n)/log(b)
g(n) = log(n)

1/logb g(n) <= f(n) <= 1/logb g(n) taking n0 = 1, c1 = c2 = 1/logb 

strictly smaller larger asymptotic bounds 

small o notation 

f(n) belongs o(g(n)) if for all constant c > 0, ther eexists a constant n0 > 0 such that ... 

small omega notation 

f(n) belongs to small(g(N)) if g(n) belongs to o(f(n))

reverse of small o 

little o example 

f(n) 2000n^2 

g(n) n^n 

f(n) is little o of g(n)

given c > 0 find n0 such that n > n0 2000n^2 < cn^n

2000 < c n^n-2 

for n >= 3 n-2 >-1 so n <= n^n-2

for n>= 3 and n >= 2000/c + 1 

2000/c < 2000/c + 1 <= n <= n^n-2 

so 2000 < cn^n-2 

takig n0 = max(3, 2000/c + 1 )
thus proves ....

Algebra of Order notations 

f(n) belongsto Theta(f(n))

Maximum rules 

O(fn + gn) = O(max(fn, gn))
Omega(fn + gn) = Omega(max(fn, gn))

Transitivity 

fn = O(gn), gn = O(hn) => fn = O(hn)

similar with Omega
 
Techniques for Order notation 

L = lim n->infinity fn/gn 

f(n) > 0 and g(n) > 0 for all n >= n0

then f(n) is 

o(gn) if L = 0
Theta(gn) if 0 < L < inifinity 
small omega(gn) if L = infinity 

Lhopital's rule 

sufficient conditions 

let fn be a polynomial of degree d >= 0

cd n^d + ..  + c0

for some cd > 0

f(n) belongs to Theta(n^d)

fn/gn = cd + cd1 * 1/n ... 

all goes to 0 except cd, a constant

so theta(gn) is true

prove n(2 + sin n pie /2 ) is theta(n)

limit does not exist

for n >= 1 

-1 <= sin(n pie / 2) <= 1 

n <= n(2+sin(...)) <= 3n 

//first principle proof

compare the growth rate of log n and n 

logN ^ c and n ^ d 

f(n) = log(n)
g(n) = n

want f(n) belongs to o(g(n))

limit test 

L'hopital 

f(n) = ln(n) / ln(2) so f'n = 1/nln(2)

g'(n) = 1

prove from first principels that

$$ 2^{\sqrt{logn}} \in o(n) $$

show that forall c > 0, exists n0 > 0, such that 
$$ |2^{\sqrt{logn}}| < c|n| \hspace{1cm}  \forall n >= n0 $$

prove 
$$2^{\sqrt{logn}}| < \sqrt{n} < c|n| $$

for n >= 17

16 < n 

4 leq logn
2 leq sqrt(logn)

2 sqrt(logn) < log(n)



 2^\sqrt{logn} < 2^log_4{n} = sqrt(n)
