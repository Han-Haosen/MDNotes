P(bi) known
P(A|Bi) known

find P(bi|A)

example :

1 % of human beings have disease A

test is 95% accurate for both cases

if have, correct prediction is 95%

if don't have, also correct prediction is 95%

B1 = have
 B2 = don't
 A = test positive

 S =B1 U B2
 B1 AND B2 = NOTHING

 P(B1) = 0.01
 P(B2) = 0.99
 P(A|B1) = 0.95
 P(A|B2) = 0.05

Prob have given that I am positive?

P(B1|A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1)/(p(A|B1) * P(b1) + p(A|b2) * p(B2))

= 0.95*0.01/(0.95*0.01+0.05*0.99)
= 0.16

p b1|a = p b1 and A / p a
