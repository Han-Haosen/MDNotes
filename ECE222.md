## Review of Number Systems

binary representation

voltage/current/switch/capacitator to represent 0/1

V(b) = Bn-1*2^n-1+... b0*20

36 = ?

36/2 0
18/2 0
9/2 1
4/2 0
2/2 0
1/2 1

100100

for that much digits largest num = 2^n-1

8 bit -- 2^8 -1

generally you need log2(k) bits when you sum

4 nubers, 2 extra bits
8 numbers, 3 extra bits

multiply, extra bits?

2n bits

positive numbers are the same

negative numbers complements

signed presentation is irrelevant -- if 0, positive, 1 negative

width need to be large enough to avoid overflow

if possesses same sign, result is different sign

making result 1 bit larger


## Tutorial Sep 10


Introduction to Lab 1

Flashing LED

IO port addressing and ocnfig

flashing LED flowhart

THUMB assembly language instructions

different memory addressing mode

test/debug on Keil

on-board RAM

Status bits and conditional branching

ALU -- Arithmatic and Logic Units

status bits are output after every computation

ZNCV Zero Negative Carry Overflow// flags

SUBS -- output flags

I/O ports and peripherals have assigned unique addresses from memory address space

address need to be used to communicate

config of I/O port must be done first


I/O is like memory except not actually doing that

1HZ

on for 0.5 and off for 0.5

check value if 0 make it 1 and vice versa

XOR function  when you do it to 1 it always invert the value

when want to toggle

place 1 at the position where you want to toggle

masking value

used in bit operations

Range for 2's complement 2^n-1 - 1 to -2^n-1

U(A bar) = 2^n - u(a)

+2 0010

-2 1110

6+-6 0110+1010 = 10000 = 0

carry because 2's complement

-2+-6

= -8

obtain a carry

1000

2^n - u(2) + 2^n -u(6)

=


4 bit and 8 bit representation

-4 = 11111100
