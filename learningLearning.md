# learning how to learn 

Focused and diffused modes 

diffuse thinking 

thinking new thoughts? diffuse mode

new neural connections 

when learn something new, needs to go back and forth 

build neural structure 

brain connectivity is dynamic 

## Procrastination 

negative stimulation 

Pomodoro 

25 min and focus 

reward 

maths have no analogies 

practice for abstract ideas 

long term memory 

working memory 

four chunks of information 

long-terms memories are stored in different regions 

need to revisit it a few times 

spaced repetition 

space this repetition out 

Sleep 


# Chunking 

compact packages 

illusions or competence in learning 

overlearning? 

interleaving 

mental leap that unites bits of info through meaning 

when you focus, octopuses to make connections 

creating a chunk 

when stressed can be less effective 

info bound thorough meaning 

reptition and diffuse-like 

embed basics 

create conceptual chunks, 

path to expertise is built by small chunks 

chunks can get bigger 

## Forming a chunk 

if learning to play a difficult song

listen/watch/patterns 

best chunks are subconcious 

extemporously means creatively mix together various complex mini chunks in the new language 

chunking is different in different subjects 

mental idea chunking 

focus -- chunking the new material 

understand basic ideas 

need to relate new to the old 

always try solve the problems 

context of chunks 

when to use the chunk 

top down bottom up pattern

making chunks and fit in the big picture 


Illusions of competence 

Recall

read the material and see what you can recall from what you read 

restudy and recall again 

retrieval process deepens learning 

need to relate AFTER building chunks 

only re read in spaced repetition 

once it's chunked, only one slot 

like a fucking pointer 

merely glancing at solution and thinking you do it? NO

look for main ideas 

one sentence or less in a paragraph 

test yourself on whatever you are doing 

test env different from your place 

need to independent from env cues 

## Seeing the bigger picture 

dopamine 

predicting future rewards 

serotonin 

Prozac

emotions affect your memory and stuff 

medulla 

Library of Chunks:

Transfer -- 

collection of neural patterns 

diffuse help connect chunks 

sequential thinking is focused 

intuition is creative diffuse 

Overlearning?

over and over again in the same session?

deliberate practice 

einstellung 

easy ideas may prevent a better idea 

unlearn wrong old ideas 

don't just jump in 

interleaving 

practice problems with different types 

varied problem sets 

interleaving builds flexibility and creativity 

2 25min sessions 

# procrastination 

building solid chunks of memory 

and you need to put in time

psychology of procrastination 

habitual avoidance 

it shares features with addiction 

from little things to worse things 

when you chunk it , it becomes a habit

it frees up your mind 

don't need to think 

habits has the cue triggers your zombie mode 

the routine 

the reward 

the belief // because you believe yourself 

process vs product 

mental tools and tricks 

focus on process not product 

avoid concentrating on product 

building processes, relate to simple habits 

product triggers pain 

spread in different sessions 

finish a session, not finishing the process 

no noises when you want to concentrate 

change the reaction to the cue 

what your cue is ? location/time/how you feel

the routine :

have a plan, developing a new ritual 

productive effects 

life and learning 

weekly list of key tasks 

daily todo -- write the evening before 

goal finishing time 

9 pm for me 

diving deeper into memory 

spacial memory system 

images are important to your memory 

repeat your images and patterns 

firmly lodged into long term memory 

handwriting can help you encode 

interleave your learning
